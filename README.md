Project 3: Scrabble AI

A Scrabble AI program that parses game data from Facebook's Scrabble application, 
reads the game state, and generates a recommendation on your best move option. The best move 
is determined by a basic algorithm that figures out the possible words you can make and 
orders that by the score it can make. This does include things like bonus spots on the board itself.
